# Part 2: Asymmetric key encryption using python

# Import the rsa library
# Use the rsa library to generate a key pair and save them
# Make a copy of the key from part 1 and place it in a file called rsa_sym_key_plain.txt
# Encrypt that file using the rsa key pair you generated. Place the encrypted version into a file called rsa_sym_key_cipher.txt
# Test it and make sure that you can decrypt it back to plain text.
